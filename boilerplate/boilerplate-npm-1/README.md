# Notes  

The MAJOR version should increment when you make incompatible API changes.  
The MINOR version should increment when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner.  
The PATCH version should increment when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.  
  
To allow an npm dependency to update to the latest PATCH version, you can prefix the dependencyâ€™s version with the tilde (~) character.  
Similar to how the tilde we learned about in the last challenge allows npm to install the latest PATCH for a dependency, the caret (^) allows npm to install future updates as well. The difference is that the caret will allow both MINOR updates and PATCHes.
